# Transaction_Fraud_Detection
This project focuses on designing and implementing a complete machine learning pipeline to detect fraudulent financial transactions. It compares multiple classification algorithms to evaluate performance and identify the most effective model for fraud detection.
Designing Machine Learning Pipeline for Classification Algorithms.
# 🧠 Overview
Fraud detection is a crucial task in financial systems where the goal is to accurately identify suspicious or fraudulent transactions while minimizing false alarms.
This project walks through a typical end-to-end ML workflow, including:

Data loading and preprocessing

Exploratory data analysis (EDA)

Feature scaling and encoding

Model training and evaluation

Model comparison and selection
